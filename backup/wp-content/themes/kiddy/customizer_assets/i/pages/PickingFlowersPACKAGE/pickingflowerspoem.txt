Life can be hard and 
we may always want more
But there are so many things 
we can be grateful for...
The sun, the wind, the bright blue sky
Beauty is everywhere if you focus your eyes
[Child’s name] looks at the flowers, 
Red, purple, blue, pink and yellow
They open every morning as if to say hello!
