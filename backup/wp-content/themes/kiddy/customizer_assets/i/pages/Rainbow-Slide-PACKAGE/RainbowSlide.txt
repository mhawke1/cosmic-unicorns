Come take a ride on the rainbow slide
It's a place where no one has to hide
We’re all embraced for the beauty that is us
Our skin tone, our gender, our religion and who we love
None of us are seen as less
Our community is  built on love and progress
Our differences are celebrated completely
Help create our utopia where we can just be!
