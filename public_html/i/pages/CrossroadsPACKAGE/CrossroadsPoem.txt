When [Child’s name]’s facing a tough decision
And doesn’t know which way to go
Take a deep breath in 
And let it out real slow
We all have an inner compass
Which guides our wrong from right
Tells us which way to go and
Shows us to the light

We have to find some quiet
We have to get real still
Shut out all distractions and 
Resolve our inner will
Or inner chatter fights us
But we must trust our heart
Our intuition can guide us 
Right from the start
