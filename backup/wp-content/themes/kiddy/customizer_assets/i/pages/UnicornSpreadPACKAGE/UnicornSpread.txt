A unicorn absorbs energy 
from the tip of their horn
Their love grows bigger 
when a baby is born!
A baby unicorn is called a sparkle, 
their horns are alicorns

For a unicorn to choose  [Child’s name],
You must be loving they warn
Be considerate of others 
Ask them how they are?
With kindness and love 
you will go far!
