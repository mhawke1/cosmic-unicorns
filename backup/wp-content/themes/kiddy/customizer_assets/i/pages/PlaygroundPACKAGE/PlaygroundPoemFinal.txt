[Child’s name] plays in the saucer
and spins round and round
Yelling "whheeeee!"  
We get dizzy and turned all around

If someone is mean
We won’t make a scene
But we tell them to stop
Because we’re kind at our park 

The park is our peace
We laugh and we play
Our friends are so nice
We could be here all day!
