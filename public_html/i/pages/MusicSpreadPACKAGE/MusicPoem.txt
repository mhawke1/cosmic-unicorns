With song [Child’s name] and friends come alive
Our cells dance and our energy sings
We connect and thrive

Through music we create
Express our sadness
Express our joy
We become present and can relate

Through music we can be here and now
Feel our bodies
Feel our soul
Feel the music it will show you how
