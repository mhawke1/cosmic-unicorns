Through rain, through wind and through rough seas
[Child’s name] sails, searching and discovering
They find adventure everywhere they go
The joy is in the journey, so let's go with the flow
In those times [Child’s name] wants to be in control
Take 3 deep breaths and let them out slow
Anddddddd.....
When seas get rough and life gets hard
It's easy to think life dealt you a bad card
But remember there is a lesson 
you can always discern
Ask your higher self what it is 
that you need to learn
