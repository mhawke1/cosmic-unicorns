[Child’s name] prepares for bed
with a simple routine,
Bath pajamas and brush my teeth,
Then my favorite, we read a book!
Please show me the pictures, I love to look!

I think of the things I’m grateful for,
my family, my friends and so much more!
I crawl into bed. Kisses, goodnight!
I focus on my breathing and close my eyes tight.
