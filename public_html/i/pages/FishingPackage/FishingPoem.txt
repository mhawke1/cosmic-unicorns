Early in the morning
Before the sun comes up
I walk to the boat with 
Some worms in my cup
Rowing out to the middle 
of the lake, I cast my line, 
take a deep breath and wait

I watch the bugs skate 
across the surface of the water
Enjoying the twinkling of ripples
As I wait for the jiggle of the bobber
Fishing is a meditation to me
Whether we catch fish or not
It's so beautiful in nature 
just to breathe and be
