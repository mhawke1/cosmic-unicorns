Under the sea
Where you can be free
And I can be me
And we can just be
[Child’s Name] is a mermaid with a beautiful tail
Strong beautiful, never frail
They swim fast and play with fish
Close their eyes tight and make a wish
Wish for a world with acceptance and love
And to bring the peace from the sea 
to land up above
