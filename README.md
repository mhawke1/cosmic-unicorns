To install the database, setup your settings within:
	/swim/settings.php
Don't forget to set your other test data in this file as well (If you need to test stripe, set that up there too)

After you set the above settings, go to: public_html/install/dbinstall.php

As long as you have the correct settings for your local environment you'll be good to go.
